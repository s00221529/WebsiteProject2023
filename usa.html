                <h1>US Legislation</h1>
                <p>The Right to Repair movement in the USA advocates for legislation that would require manufacturers to provide access to repair information, tools, and parts to independent repair technicians and farmers. 
                    This movement is particularly relevant to farm machinery, as farmers often rely on equipment that is expensive to repair or replace and require the ability to quickly and affordably fix their equipment to continue their livelihood. 
                    Proponents argue that the right to repair would benefit farmers, promote competition and innovation, and reduce e-waste. Several states in the USA have introduced right to repair bills for farm machinery, but none have yet been enacted into law.<a href="https://www.repair.org/legislation">Read more...</a></p>

                <h1>Farming Machinery</h1>
                <p>The American Farm Bureau Federation, National Farmers Union and the National Corn Growers are all in support of Right to Repair.  
                    They have teamed up with us in front of the US Copyright Office to get specific exemptions to repair all “Land Based Motor Vehicles” including the right to hire those they trust to help.<a href="https://www.repair.org/agriculture">Read more...</a></p>
