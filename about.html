                <h1>FAQ</h1>
                <h2>Why is it better to repair than to replace an electronic item?</h2>
                <p>Electronic products have a high environmental footprint. It takes precious raw materials and considerable amounts of energy to manufacture them. 
                    When these products are discarded, all of the embedded energy as well as many materials are lost
                     - only a small portion can be effectively recovered through recycling. 
                    This is why extending the lifetime of electric and electronic products through repair is the most efficient way to reduce their overall environmental footprint.

                <h2>Why do we need a legislation for the right to repair?</h2>
                <p>We can't expect the market to solve this problem. 
                    If it is more profitable for manufacturers to sell new products than to facilitate repair, only legislation can make sure that manufacturers enable us to have our products repaired, 
                    or repair them ourselves by providing the necessary tools and information.

                <h2>Don't we already have the right to repair our product?</h2>
                <p>While it is obviously not illegal for you to repair a product that you own, there is no legal framework to ensure that you can. For instance, 
                    you don't always have the right to obtain the repair instructions, spare parts, or specialised tools 
                    that you would need to repair your product. Your right to repair stops where the manufacturer's right to produce a non-repairable product begins.
