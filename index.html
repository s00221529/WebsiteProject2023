                <h1>Summary</h1>
                <p>Right to repair is a movement aimed at giving individuals and independent repair businesses access to the tools, parts, and information needed to repair products such as electronics, appliances, and vehicles. It's a consumer protection issue that seeks to ensure that people have the ability to fix their own belongings or choose where to take them for repair, rather than being forced to rely on the original manufacturer or authorized repair providers.</p>
                <p>The right to repair movement advocates for manufacturers to make their products more repairable and for laws to be passed to ensure that individuals and repair businesses have access to the necessary information, parts, and tools to repair products. The movement argues that this will reduce electronic waste and help consumers save money by avoiding costly repairs or replacements.</p>
                <p>The movement has gained momentum in recent years, particularly in the United States and Europe, with legislation being proposed or passed to protect the right to repair. Supporters of the movement argue that it is an important step towards promoting sustainability, reducing electronic waste, and empowering consumers.</p>
