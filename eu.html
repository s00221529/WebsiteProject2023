                <h1>EU Legislation</h1>
                <p>The right to repair movement has gained significant momentum in the EU in recent years. In 2021, the EU introduced new rules that require manufacturers to make certain household appliences , such as washing machines, fridges, and TVs, more easily repairable. These rules are part of the EU's broader efforts to promote a circular economy and reduce e-waste.</p>
                <p>Under the new EU rules, manufacturers will be required to ensure that products are designed in such a way that they can be easily disassembled and that replacement parts are readily available. Manufacturers will also be required to provide repair information to professional repairers and consumers.
                    The EU has also extended these rules to electronic devices, such as smartphones and laptops. EU proposed rules would require smartphone manufacturers to make spare parts and repair information available to independent repair shops and to design smartphones in such a way that they can be easily repaired.<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_1794">Read more...</a></p>

                <h1>Design For The Future</h1>
                <p>Products should not only be designed to perform, but also to last and to be repaired whenever needed. In order to make products which are easy to repair we need design practices which support ease of disassembly.
                    Our short term goal: EU legislation sets horizontal minimum design requirements to ensure easy disassembly and replacement of key components in all products.<a href="https://repair.eu/what-we-want/">Read more...</a></p>
